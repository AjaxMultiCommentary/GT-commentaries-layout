## Data

This dataset contains layout annotations for ca. 370 pages sampled from 8 public domain classical commentaries, published in the 19th century in English, German and Latin. The commentaries concern Ancient Greek and Latin works from prose and poetry (caveat: AGreek poetry is slightly over-represented). 

An example of annotated commentary page is shown in the image below. Pages were annotated according to a taxonomy mapped to the [SegmOnto](https://segmonto.github.io/) controlled vocabulary.
